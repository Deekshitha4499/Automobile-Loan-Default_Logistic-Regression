Goal:
The goal of the problem is to predict whether a client will default on the vehicle loan payment or not.

In this Data-set,have done data preprocessing,Data wrangling, Performed EDA, develope a model to perform Logistic Regression and find the accuracy of model. Also done Tuning of the model by using Grid Search CV tuning method and RandomSerach Tuning method. 
Ploted Precision-Recall Curves(PRC) and Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC) , also ploted confusion matrix before and after the tuning.
Also performed Support Vector Machine(SVM),Naive Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) in this dataset as well.
